# Tree-based Methods

- Non-parametric methods
- Can be used for both regression and classification

Idea: Divide the predictor space into regions R_1, R_2, ..., R_J into J distinct and non-overlapping regions

Types of decision trees
- CART

## Pros
- Simple
- Interpretable

## Cons
- Not the most powerful when used alone
- Prone to overfitting
- At times, *seems like an oversimplification*
- Not better than linear models when the bayes decision boundary is linear

## Types of tree-based methods
- [[Decision Trees]]
- [[Bagging Trees]]
- [[Random Forests]]
- [[Boosting]]
