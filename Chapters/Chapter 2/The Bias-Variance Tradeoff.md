# Bias-Variance Tradeoff

The reducible error has two components
- Bias
- Variance

**Bias:** How wrong is the model from the ground truth?
**Variance:** How different are the model's predictions everytime its run on different samples of data from the same population?

## The role of flexibility

A model that is more flexible tends to have higher variance and lower bias

Choosing this flexibility is what leads to the bias-variance tradeoff!
