# Introduction

Statistics have been around since the 1900s or even before that.

## Statistical learning vs Machine learning
- Very similar
- The parent
	- ML is a subfield of artificial intelligence
	- SL is a subfield of statistics
- The focus
	- ML is about prediction accuracy and large amounts of data
	- SL is about models, interpretability and uncertainty 
- The public perception
	- ML sounds fancy
	- SL sounds nerdy

## Different types of learning
There are two main types of learning
- [[The Supervised Learning Problem]]
- [[Chapters/Chapter 1/Unsupervised Learning]]

There is also a 3rd type called **Reinforcement learning**, but that is beyond the scope of this material.
