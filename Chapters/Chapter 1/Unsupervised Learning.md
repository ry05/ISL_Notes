# Unsupervised Learning

When [[The Supervised Learning Problem]] exists, it should be evident that unsupervised learning problems too exist.

In unsupervised learning problems, there are
- ONLY predictor features
- NO target feature

The key idea is to *discover patterns* by similarity of features between observations.

**What's a natural advantage associated with this?**   
It's EASY TO COLLECT DATA when the problem is unsupervised as there is no need to label the data

**What's a natural disadvantage associated with this?**  
It's hard to evaluate performance. Probably you need some ground-truth data to compare with your finds.
